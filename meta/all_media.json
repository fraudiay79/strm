                "plot": "Dexter knows it\u2019s only a matter of time before Miami Metro discovers the Trinity Killer\u2019s latest handiwork. Therefore, he has to work doubly hard to stay one step ahead of their investigation. Dexter has begun to realize that the closer he gets to Trinity, the more he stands to learn from this very different beast. Trinity hides behind a well-kept mask, and getting behind that facade will require some extra prodding on Dexter\u2019s part. Meanwhile, Debra becomes frustrated when she finds herself shut out from her own case. She considers bending the rules in the name of justice, risking her career in the process. LaGuerta and Batista come to regret a major decision, and realize that by playing by the rules they may have painted themselves into a corner. And when the friction between Rita and Dexter comes to a head, Dexter gleans relationship advice from a most unlikely source.",

However, his plans seem to be thwarted every step of the way. Quinn has taken a renewed interest in Dexter's nightlife.

The opening credits of subsequent episodes, after a recap of previous episodes, begin with a video title card unique to each episode. For the second episode of the season, for example, a highway sign reads \"Weeds -- Created by Jenji Kohan\" \u2014 the embedded text used for all title cards since the show's inception. Each title card also has a prop or part of the setting that refers to a plot element in the episode. Some part of the title card morphs into a marijuana leaf. In the highway sign example, a downward arrow designating a lane becomes a slightly larger pot leaf.\n\nSilas and Shane are aged 17 and 13 respectively. However, Silas turns 18 at the end of the season.",
