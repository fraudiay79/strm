As Claire and Jamie build their life together in the rough and dangerous backcountry of North Carolina, they must negotiate a tenuous loyalty to the current British ruling class, despite Claire\u2019s knowledge of the bloody rebellion to come.

But as they grow closer, the young couple realize they have very different ideas about the future of their relationship. However, when Roger and Brianna search for proof that Brianna\u2019s parents reunited in the 18th century, a shocking discovery makes them both consider following in Claire\u2019s footsteps.",
