The opening credits of subsequent episodes, after a recap of previous episodes, begin with a video title card unique to each episode. For the second episode of the season, for example, a highway sign reads \"Weeds -- Created by Jenji Kohan\" \u2014 the embedded text used for all title cards since the show's inception. Each title card also has a prop or part of the setting that refers to a plot element in the episode. Some part of the title card morphs into a marijuana leaf. In the highway sign example, a downward arrow designating a lane becomes a slightly larger pot leaf.\n\nSilas and Shane are aged 17 and 13 respectively.

Kohan also confirmed that the song would be covered in a duet by Steve Martin and series regular Kevin Nealon, who each sang and played the banjo. Series co-star Hunter Parrish also provided a cover version for the season's tenth episode. The final two episodes of the season aired back to back as a one-hour series finale, which was the series' first and only one hour show in its eight-year run.",
