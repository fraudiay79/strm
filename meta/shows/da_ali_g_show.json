            "plot": "Ali G gets relationship advice from Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus author John Gray. Excited to discuss reproductive rights with a lesbian couple (after all, \"he's got loads of\" their videos), Ali G then goes to a pro-choice march in Washington, where he questions pro-lifers about their beliefs. Borat goes job-hunting, learning about American work ethics from various employment agencies. Ali G talks money with former presidential economics advisor Charles Schultze, who gives stock market advice (\"don't be high when you're buying and selling\"). Bruno gets wrestling lessons from a college team on spring break in Daytona Beach. And finally, Ali G gets some grammar tips from 60 Minutes pundit Andy Rooney.",
